<p class='c012'>Most readers of the <span class='sc'>Naturalist</span> are probably aware that the
University maintains at Sandusky a lake laboratory, devoted to the
investigation and study of the life of the lake region. As this
number of the <span class='sc'>Naturalist</span> is devoted mostly to reports upon work
which has been done there, it may be of interest to give some facts
regarding opportunities offered and the character of the work provided
for.</p>

<p class='c007'>The laboratory was first opened by Professor Kellicott in 1895,
with a view specially to give opportunity for investigation, and he
and several of his students engaged in work there through the summers
of ’95–6–7. Some of the results of these studies were published,
especially Professor Kellicott’s report upon the Rotifers of Sandusky
Bay and the list of Odonata for the State, which includes numerous
records for that locality. During the summer of 1899 the writer and
several associates occupied the laboratory, and studies upon the
fishes of the locality, records of Hemiptera and some other groups
have been incorporated in different papers. In 1900 the scope of
the laboratory was enlarged so as to provide courses of instruction
in Botany and Zoology, and a number of students and investigators
improved the opportunity to work during the summer vacation.
Reports on the Odonata, sponges, Bryozoa, and the notes on birds
appearing in the present issue indicate the range of the studies
engaged in  that season. However, many lines of study which
were begun by different students and which will require several
seasons for observations, are not as yet ready for publication.
It may be noted, however, that the flora of the locality has been
very thoroughly collected by Professor Moseley, of the Sandusky
High School, and his publication on the “Sandusky Flora”
furnishes an admirable guide to the location of the various species
of plants, and an excellent basis for additional investigation. The
laboratory will at present accommodate twenty-five or thirty students,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>and its capacity will doubtless be increased as necessity requires.
It is a two-story frame building 22 × 66 feet, the upper floor of which
is used for investigation and the lower in part for students’ laboratory
tables. It is supplied with city water, a number of aquaria, has
a convenient dark room for photographic work, and answers admirably
for the purpose for which it is used—that is, for a temporary
summer laboratory. The laboratory is supplied with two boats
equipped with sails, and designed especially for work in the bay and
marshes. Dredges, seines, plankton net and other collecting apparatus
are provided, while microscopes, microtomes, books, and other laboratory
equipments are taken from the university.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>While under the management of the Ohio State University, it
is desired to make the laboratory as useful as possible to instructors
and investigators in biology, wherever located. To this end table
room is granted free of charge to qualified investigators, and any
one wishing to undertake investigation of biological problems will
be given all possible opportunity. Courses of study have been
designed especially for high school teachers and for advanced university
students, the former devoting themselves to methods of field
work and preservation of material for laboratory use, and acquiring
methods of laboratory work in connection with study of typical
forms. For the latter, advanced courses in embryology, morphology,
entomology, plant ecology, botany, etc., are offered. The
students taking such courses can secure for them university credits
covering equivalent courses in the university curriculum. It is
needless to say that the opportunities for field observation, collecting,
and the laboratory study of representative forms are most
favorable. For special advanced courses in embryology, and particularly
those pertaining to microscopical technique, the more
elaborate equipment of the university is of course preferable.</p>

<p class='c012'>The visitor or student at the Lake Laboratory will find in the
neighborhood of Sandusky a flora in many respects peculiar and
richer in species perhaps than in any other region of similar area in
the state of Ohio. For our knowledge of the Sandusky plants we are
indebted mainly to the continued and energetic explorations of E.
L. Moseley, teacher of botany in the Sandusky High School. Our
visits to the region have been numerous, and many weeks have been
spent in herborizing during the last few seasons. Mr. Moseley’s
Sandusky Flora (Ohio State Academy of Science, Special Papers
No. 1) and additions by myself and Mr. Griggs reported before the
Academy of Science, and published in <span class='sc'>The Ohio Naturalist</span>, Vol.
1, fully represent our knowledge of this interesting flora to date.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the “Sandusky Flora,” page 2, Mr. Moseley states that “the
surpassing richness of the Sandusky flora is not due to the fact that it
includes islands within its territory, for scarcely any of its species
are confined to the islands; nor is it in a very large measure due to
the fact that it includes species that are confined to the lake shore;
but rather to peculiarities of climate and geological features, both
of which depend to some extent on the proximity of the lake.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Space will allow reference to but few of the interesting and rarer
plants. On Cedar Point and a few other places the Prickly pear,
Opuntia humifusa, appears in great abundance, but is reported for
no other stations in Ohio. The illustration (Fig. 1) shows a patch of
this plant, and also indicates the sparse vegetation in the open sandy
Black Oak woods of Cedar Point. Here we found three specimens
of the rare Lea’s Oak, one fine specimen of the common Juniper
(Juniperus communis), two specimens of the Sand cherry (Prunus
pumila), none of which are given in the “Sandusky Flora” for this
place, and one only—the Juniper—for Catawba. Of other rare or
specially interesting plants for this point the following may be
mentioned: Ammophila arenaria, Panicum virgatum, Salix glaucophylla,
Salix sericea, Euphorbia polygonifolia, Pinus strobus,
Stipa spartea, Chenopodium leptophyllum, Lepargyraea canadensis,
Œnothera rhombipetala, Artemisia caudata, Arctostaphylos uvaursi,
Symphoricarpus pauciflorus, Utricularia gibba and Lacinaria
scariosa.</p>

<p class='c007'>By no means the least interesting vegetation on Cedar Point
are the dune plants, many species of arenophilous species, and
efficient soil binders. Some idea of the appearance of a few of such
plants may be gained from the cut (Fig. 2), which shows one of the
sand hills held exclusively by the roots of the Red Cedar. Other
similar hillocks are held by one of the wild grape vines, Vitis vulpina,
and many other plants. The tufts of some of the grasses, especially
Panicum virgatum, can be seen in the same illustration.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Marblehead and Catawba the flora is equally rich in local
and interesting plants. Huge Buckeyes occur, one of which measures
nine feet and two inches in circumference. The Red Oaks are
numerous and remarkably variable in their fruits. There occurs
Zygadena elegans and Kœleria cristata, Meibomia illonoensis, Solanum
rostratum, and Picradenia acaulis—all western species. The
Lakeside Daisy, as the Picradenia has been locally named, is especially
attractive. It occurs in one place in Illinois, but otherwise
known only far west of the Mississippi river.</p>

<p class='c007'>Elsewhere, and especially in the prairie region of Erie county,
there occur such rare species as Aletris fainosa, Aristida gracilis
and A. purpurascens, Salix candida, Prunus cuneata, Psoralea pedunculata,
Rhexia virginica, Eryngium yuccifolium, Asclepias obtusifolia
and A. sullivantii, and Helianthus mollis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bay is even richer, presenting acres and acres of Nelumbo,
Sagittaria, Potamogetons, Rushes, Reeds, Duckweeds, Polygonum,
Ceratophyllum, and others too numerous to mention. The innumerable
and unenumerated Algae must not go unmentioned—here, as in
many other lines, the enthusiastic students will reap a rich harvest.</p>

<p class='c012'>Cedar Point offers a number of rather peculiar features for study,
and the fauna of the locality presents a very attractive field. On
the one hand there is an extensive beach some six or seven miles in
length, from which the sand dune formation extends backwards and
merges into a swampy area bordering the waters of Sandusky Bay.
On the beach after every storm will be found a large mass of drift
material, including numerous fishes that have been thrown ashore.
These furnish an attraction for a number of forms of animals, a
complete census of which has as yet not been attempted. It may be
mentioned, however, that numerous species of flies take to them to
deposit their eggs, the larvae a few days after each storm being a
conspicuous element to be followed a few days later by pupae or
mature flies; these in turn attract various birds and large numbers of
toads, which seem to secure a very constant source of food especially
in this vicinity. Species of burrowing Hymenoptera are conspicuous
and upon the sand dunes the grasshopper (<i>Trimeroptropis maritima</i>)
is especially abundant. A millipede (<i>Fontaria indianae</i>) is also very
abundant crawling over the sand, and turtles from the lake pass up
the beach and over the dunes to deposit their eggs at favorable
points.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Foot Prints.</span>—A study of the tracks and foot prints which are
made in the sand is especially interesting, and the determination of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>species which are responsible for particular kinds of tracks is a
fascinating though somewhat complicated study. Several of these
have been identified with certainty, and a brief description of them
in connection with a reproduction of some photographs may be of
interest. Toad tracks are numerous and quite conspicuous and consist
of four slight imprints in the sand, these occurring with regularity in
length corresponding with the length of the leap and the tracks,
with the distance between them, corresponding with the size of the
individual. These are shown in Figure 2, between the points marked
X. The abundant grasshopper, described more fully in another paragraph,
produces when walking a continuous series of fine imprints in
two or three more or less distinct lines on either side, midway between
which is a narrow groove formed by the dragging of the abdomen.
These tracks begin and end abruptly in case the insect is alarmed
and leaps into the air. Several of these lines of imprint are shown
in the figure—one distinct one above the point in Figure 2, marked
+. Another very characteristic one that is easily referred to the
millipede consists of parallel lines, in which the imprints of the
individual feet are scarcely visible, and between which the sand is
smoothed by the under surface of the body. In Fig. 2 under <i>o</i>.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 3.—Pitfalls and Tracks of Ant Lions.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Ant Lion.</span>—Still another very characteristic member of the
dune fauna is the ant lion, the larvae of which construct their
characteristic pitfalls in slightly protected places near bushes or
trees, sometimes in great numbers, indicating a very numerous
colony of these curious creatures. Of these there are, judging by the
larvae, two quite distinct species common to the Point, but these
have not as yet been reared. Aside from the pitfalls these ant lions
make a peculiar track in the sand when they are moving from one
point to another. These movements apparently occur only during
short periods, as is shown when an area which has been entirely free
from such tracks will be noticed after an hour or two to be completely
netted with their devious furrows, which could only be
formed by a number of larvae. The larvae move backward, and
from the character of the furrows produced in the sand, must remain
just beneath the surface of the sand, as the sand is raised on
either side. That the furrows are formed by these larvae is proven
by the fact that if the pitfalls at their ends be dug into they will be
found to contain larvae. The movements of the larvae, forcibly produced,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>make lines like those observed. Pitfalls and furrows are
illustrated in the accompanying plates, the furrows being quite indistinct,
as they are not deep enough to produce distinct shade, and
consequently do not show conspicuously in the photograph. Furrows
are to be noted, however, in the figure (No. 3) above the points
marked X.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Eagle Nests.</span>—The bald eagle nests at various points along the
lake shore, and some of these nests were observed, and photographs
secured during the past summer. One of these is between Sandusky
and Huron, about two miles from Huron, and a half mile from the
Huron street railway, in a Shag bark hickory tree. It stands away
from other timber, although it is said formerly to have been surrounded
entirely by trees. It is probably one hundred and twenty-five
feet in height, or more, and doubtless towered above surrounding
trees, and at present constitutes the most conspicuous object to be
seen for miles in any direction. The nest, as shown in the accompanying
photographs, must be at least a hundred feet from the ground,
but owing to the impossibility of climbing the tree, and from the
fact that no exact means of measurement were at hand, the precise
height is unknown. This nest, we were told, has been in this tree
only a few years, but prior to its building one has existed in the immediate
locality for at least thirty years past. The nest is evidently
five or six feet in diameter, being somewhat more flattened than
other nests observed, owing probably to the spreading character of
the limbs upon which it rests. No eagles were to be seen at the
time of our visit to the tree, but we were informed by the proprietor
of the farm that they had reared a brood during the season, and one
was seen later by Mr. Griggs, at the time his photograph was taken.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other nests occur on Kelly’s Island, and we made a trip to that
locality for the purpose of noting them and taking photographs,
which, however, on account of the day being unfavorable, are not
very clear, and cannot be reproduced to advantage. They are about
a mile and a half eastward from the steamboat landing, one occurring
in a Maple tree about seventy-five feet in height, and the nest
at a height of about sixty-five feet, being at least six feet in height,
fitting the somewhat acute crotch, and at least five or six feet
across the top. The other is in a Burr Oak tree, some distance from
other trees, in a vineyard, and plainly to be seen from the lake
steamers when to the southeast of the landing. The tree is about a
hundred feet high, and the nest is about eighty or eighty-five feet from
the ground. It is similar in form to the one just mentioned. Portions
can be seen to contain very large branches, which show out conspicuously
from the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Trimerotropis maritima.</span>—This grasshopper which is very
abundant on the dunes along Cedar Point Beach, is of special interest
because of its protective resemblance to the sand on which it ordinarily
rests. It is one of the best examples I have seen of adaptive
coloration, but does not seem to have been mentioned in such
connection, possibly because the colors change in preserved specimens
so that the mimicry is totally lost. They reach maturity in latter
part of June, and while only larvae are seen in middle of June,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>nearly all have matured by the latter part of July. They occur
most abundantly on the sand adjacent to the clumps of grass upon
which they doubtless feed, though so far no individuals have been
observed actually feeding on grass leaves, but one was observed
eating a fragment of apple cast up in drift materials on the beach.
When disturbed they invariably alight on the sand, upon which
they become at once invisible. About the only way to capture them
is to throw a net down on a spot where one has been seen to alight,
and then it not infrequently happens that two or even three will be
caught though their presence has not been suspected.</p>

<p class='c007'>The adult is whitish gray speckled with ferruginous fuscous and
black, conspicuous ferruginous points occurring usually on the
anterior margin of pronotum and on the lower borders of epimera of
meso- and meta-thorax, humeri of elytra and discal carina of femur,
these may be faint or obsolete, and on wings and legs may form
slender lides; dark freckles occur on carinæ of vertex and face,
forming a series back of collar on pronotum, on posterior border of
pronotum and on sides of elytra and hind femora; on elytra they
are thicker at three places, one-fourth, one-half and two-thirds from
base, constituting fairly distinct patches, and on femur are two
indistinct bands corresponding with well marked black bands on the
inner side. Anterior and middle femora and tibiæ nearly white,
milky, with gray annulations; hind tibiæ gray at base, distal two-thirds
yellow, in one form orange or reddish, spines yellow, tipped
with black, anterior and middle tarsi ferruginous or reddish, hind
tarsi yellow. The sternum is finely pilose. A variety is quite
uniformly yellowish gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>The larvae are similarly speckled but differ in that the dorsum
of abdomen is densely speckled, while in adults this part protected
by the folded wings is not speckled. In all these points a perfect
adaptation to the color and markings that blend with the sand grains
is evident.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the latter part of the summer of 1899, many of these grasshoppers
died from an attack of parasitic fungus, and in such cases
climbed up on stems of grass where their whitened bodies became
very conspicuous. Eggs are doubtless laid in autumn probably in
packed sand in grass clumps to hatch in following spring.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ecologically Cedar Point is an exceedingly interesting region.
It is a narrow peninsula on one side of which flourishes a xerophytic
dune flora, and on the other a luxuriant hydrophytic marsh flora.
The meeting of these two gives the flora a very peculiar aspect.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Except at its tip Cedar Point has never been inhabited. It is still in
very nearly its primitive condition. With a view to seeing how
these and other factors peculiar to the region have influenced its
bird life, these notes have been assembled. No pretentions to systematic
completeness are made; the present purpose is more to
determine the general character of the avifauna than to give a
complete list including many accidental or occasional species which
would overshadow the more characteristic residents. The observations
upon which these notes are based were taken during the
summer months (1900) when there were few species migrating, so
that with the exceptions noted they include only the bulk of the
summer residents at the Point. The birds of the marsh and bay are
so inseparable from those of the point proper, that the commoner of
them have been included, though no special study of them was
made. The following birds were observed:</p>

<p class='c007'>Sterna hirundo Linn. Common Tern, common.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>PLANT STUDY AT SANDUSKY BAY.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Harriet G. Burr.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>To one whose work has not included collecting and study in such
surroundings as Sandusky Bay affords, the revelation of even a few
days here is worth a great deal. The marshes about Sandusky, the
rocky islands, the sand dunes at Cedar Point, the “prairie” in the
direction of Castalia, all offer valuable work to the student of
ecology.</p>

<p class='c007'>But during the week spent at the Lake Laboratory last August
it was in study of the water plants of the Bay that I found the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>greatest interest. The collecting is after a manner novel to the
“land lubber.” The collections, carried back to the Laboratory for
study, have the fascination of the unusual, for represented among
them are families more or less unfamiliar to general students.</p>

<p class='c007'>A collecting trip for water-plants usually takes one across the
Bay among the bulrushes and wild rice along Cedar Point. Here
from the sides of the boat we look down into a wilderness of strange
forms through the clear water. The curious eel-grass, with its
perfect spirals, Myriophyllum and Chara, Philotria, Utricularia, and
the Potamogetons spread out upon the surface among the lily-pads
around us, are among the most conspicuous. A few minutes collecting
here is productive of results quite out of proportion to the
time spent. Many of these plants, at the time of my visit, had lifted
themselves to the surface and bore their inflorescence above the
water. Among these were some of the Potamogetons, Utricularia,
Philotria, and others. A marigold looked strangely out of place on
the surface of the water—it was the Bidens Beckii in bloom. The
American Lotus lifted its head conspicuously above its lesser neighbors.
Some minute, light-colored, fluffy masses, floating far out in
the Bay, we decided to be the pollen of the Vallisneria.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have said nothing of the Algae; the most of my work at the
Laboratory, however, was with these forms. Many kinds are common
and many more may be obtained by seeking for them. These
types of plant life, in beauty of form and importance of study rivaled
by none, repay much time spent upon them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The collecting and study of only a week here—a week, too, of
recreation rather than of work—was but a suggestion of what might
be done, though one which proved quite powerful. From our landing
at Cedar Point was visible, for a long distance out, the bright pink
of a Swamp Rose Mallow. It typified the week’s work, it was a
suggestion, too, of other strangers which might be lurking behind
those trees and among those vines and undergrowth. We found
that the suggestion was not a vain one, and in following it out we
were never disappointed.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>DRAGONFLIES OF SANDUSKY.</h2>

    <div><span class='sc'>James S. Hine.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>As the dragonflies of Sandusky have been quite carefully collected
for a number of years, it may be worth while to give the
result in the form of a list with notes on some of the species.</p>

<p class='c007'>Calopteryx maculata and Hetaerina americana have not been
taken as commonly as in some places, for the locality does not
furnish their most desirable surroundings.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>The genus Lestes is represented by unguiculatus, uncatus, disjunctus,
forcipatus, rectaugularis, vigilax, inequalis and eurinus.
Nearly all of these species are abundant and are mostly found among
the grass at the edge of the marsh.</p>

<p class='c007'>The genus <i>Argia</i> is represented by four species, putrida, violacea,
sedula and apicalis. The first two are very numerous in individuals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nehalennia posita and irene; Enallagma civile, ebrium, carunculatum,
aspersum, exsulans, geminatum, antennatum, signatum
pollutum; Amphiagrion saucium and Ischnura verticalis have all
been taken, usually near the water’s edge.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Gomphines are not represented by a great number of species.
Gomphus vastus is exceedingly common, and fraternus, furcifer,
exilis, spicatus and plagiatus have been taken. Dromogomphus
spinosus is also common.</p>

<p class='c007'>Epiaeschna heros and Æschna verticalis and constricta may
occasionally be seen, especially about the time the sun sets, catching
small insects for food. Anax junius is the most conspicuous species
in the locality from May to September.</p>

<p class='c007'>Macromia illinoiensis is a very common species. At certain
times the males and females of this species may be found in numbers
in quiet places among bushes, where they come to rest on the under
side of branches, their bodies being at an angle of about thirty
degrees with the branch. They are easily approached at such times,
and two females and four males have been taken at a single sweep
of the net.</p>

<p class='c007'>Epicordulia princeps, Tetragoneuria cynosura, Tramea carolina
and lacerata and Pantala flavescens are occasionally seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neurocordulia yamaskanensis has only been taken once on
Rattlesnake Island. It is a rare species, but one that is more common
in the northern states.</p>

<p class='c007'>The genus Libellula is represented by basalis, 4-maculata, semifasciata,
pulchella and incesta; and Sympetrum by obtrusum,
rubicundulum, vicinum, senicinctum and corruptum.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pachydiplax longipennis, Plathemis lydia, mesothemis simplicicollis,
Perithemis domitia, Leucorhinia intacta and Celethemis
eponina and elisa are abundant, and with the members of the genus
Libellula furnish a very large percentage of the dragonfly life of the
Sandusky Marshes.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>SPONGES AND BRYOZOANS OF SANDUSKY BAY.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><span class='sc'>F. L. Landacre.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The two small groups of fresh water sponges and Bryozoa received
some attention at the Lake laboratory during the summer
of 1900.</p>

<p class='c007'>All our fresh water sponges belong to one family, the <i>Spongillidae</i>,
which has about seven genera. They differ from the marine sponges
in two particulars. They form skeletons of silicon only, while
marine sponges may form silicious or limy or spongin skeletons.
The spongin skeleton is the one that gives the bath sponge its value.</p>

<p class='c007'>They also form winter buds or statoblasts which carry the
sponge over the winter and reproduce it again in the spring. This
peculiar process was probably acquired on account of the changes in
temperature and in amount of moisture to which animals living in
fresh water streams are subjected. The sponge dies in the fall of
the year and its skeleton of silicious spines or spicules can be found
with no protoplasm. The character of the spines in the body of the
sponge and those surrounding the statoblast differ greatly, and those
around the statoblast are the main reliance in identifying sponges.
So that if a statoblast is found the sponge from which it came can
be determined, and on the other hand it is frequently very difficult
to determine the species of a sponge if it has not yet formed its statoblast.
The statoblast is a globular or disc-shaped, nitroginous cell
with a chimney-like opening where the protoplasm escapes in the
spring. The adult sponge is non-sexual but the statoblasts give rise
to ova and spermatozoa which unite and produce a new sponge. The
statoblast is considered as the sexual generation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three species belonging to one of the seven genera were positively
identified.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Spongilla fragilis</i>, Leidy, a very common form was found on submerged
rocks on the south side of the bay near the city in great
abundance. Its yellow statoblasts are numerous and placed in
layers near the base of the sponge on the rock to which it is
attached.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another species <i>Spongilla cinerea</i>, Carter, was found on floating
timber. It is ashen gray in color.</p>

<p class='c007'>A third species <i>Spongilla aspinosa</i>, Potts, was found in Black
Channel and near the city on submerged rocks. Its color is green.
Other species were found but not definitely determined.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fresh water Polyozoa comprise a small group of animals
resembling the sponges in the process of statoblast formation, but
otherwise totally different. Their real relationship is not definitely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>known. They are among the most beautiful of our lower fresh
water forms. The body is nearly always protected by a cyst from
which the anterior end of the animal projects when undisturbed and
into which it can be retracted. There is a larval form resembling
that of the worms and several other invertebrate groups, and a
marked metamorphosis to the adult form. The statoblasts as in the
sponges are of value in identification, and are formed on a strand of
tissue connecting the base of the animal to its cyst. The individuals
or Polyps increase in number by budding.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two species are quite common at Sandusky. <i>Plumatella polymorpha</i>
as its name indicates is quite variable in form. The variety
<i>repens</i> was very common on the rocks on the south side of bay near the
city. Its vine-like appearance renders it easy to identify. The
Polyps are borne on the ends of the branches. The vine-like cyst
clings closely to its support. The second species <i>Pectinatella magnifica</i>
was found in Black Channel on submerged fish nets. It has a
large spherical gelatinous base frequently eight or ten inches in
diameter, over which the colonies of polyps are distributed. The
individuals in each colony are arranged in the form of an aster.
These large colonies are striking in appearance. The larvae are quite
numerous and are globular in shape, and swim quite freely when
liberated from the parent colony. The statoblasts are found in the
fall as in the sponges. The process of statoblast formation and of
larval development were studied, but the budding of individuals to
enlarge the colony was not followed. The statoblasts of these animals
seem to need to be both dried and frozen before development
will go on in the spring.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Sorghum Smut in Adams County.</span>—A small field of Sorghum
near Mineral Springs Station, Adams County, Ohio, was observed
last November to be badly infected with the grain smut of Sorghum,
known to botanists as ustilago sorghi, or perhaps more correctly
designated (according to G. P. Clinton) as Cintractia sorghi-vulgaris.
A careful inspection of the harvested stalks, still piled in the field,
showed that fully twenty per cent. of the panicles or heads were
infected. When there is infection by this smut, usually every grain
in the panicle is smutted according to repeated observations in
various localities. The field in question was very thickly planted to
sorghum, the crop evidently being intended for stock feed. The
only other locality reported in Ohio for this smut, so far as at present
recalled, is Columbus, where however it has occurred only upon
artificial infection. Broom corn also was here successfully infected.
Sorghum is often cultivated, but not in large quantities in Ohio; a
large acreage of broom corn is however annually planted. Request
is hereby made for reports in case this smut is noticed in other
localities in our State. The Head-smut of Sorghum, Ustilago
reiliana, should also be reported if observed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Notes on some Rusts.</span>—M. A. Carleton, of the United States
Department of Agriculture, has published some observations and
experiments on a few rusts that are of special interest, and may well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>be noted here. He has shown that the common and abundant
Spurge Rust, occurring on very many species of Euphorbia (twelve
of which are listed in the Ohio Flora) is able to propagate itself constantly
through the germinating seed of its host, and therefore
becomes in that way practically a perennial species. He remarks
that “It is the only demonstrated example of this manner of propagation
in the whole order of Uredineae. Actual cluster-cups may
be seen in the hulled seeds of Euphorbia dentata. Seedlings kept
under bell jars become rusted three months from the date of planting,
showing all stages of the rust, while seeds disinfected with
mercuric chloride produce no rusted plants.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Ohio Hybrid Oaks.</span>—The Ohio Oaks have received as yet no critical
study, though notes as to their variation have occasionally and
indirectly got into print. It is often suggested that there may be
numerous hybrid forms, though mere guesses are scarcely of any
significance. Lea’s Oak, which is now known to occur in Ohio at
four stations, namely, Cincinnati (the original locality reported),
Brownsville in Licking County (tree since cut down), Columbus
(one specimen), and Cedar Point in Erie County, has been known
for years. It has been generally referred to Quercus imbricaria and
Quercus velutina for its parentage, though Mr. Fischer was of opinion
that the Columbus specimen was a cross between Quercus rubra
and Quercus imbricarica. It was a matter of much interest when
Mr. A. D. Selby reported, at the December Meeting of the Ohio
Academy of Science, that he observed a hybrid Oak, a single tree,
growing at Lakeville, Holmes County. The parentage he refers to
Quercus alba and questionably Quercus inbricaria. He reports it
with pronounced aspect of Q. alba “save in the elongated, short-lobed
leaves which obviously approach those of Q. inbricaria.”
While certain resemblances to Q. acuminata may suggest themselves
(were his words) this species has not been observed in the immediate
region. No mature fruit was seen. We may perhaps venture
to suggest that the evidence for its hybridity between the two
species named—one an annual-fruited and the other a biennial-fruited
species—is suspiciously slender, and it is hoped that mature
fruit and further inspection may put the case beyond doubt.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Asparagus Rust Abundant on Young Plants.</span>—An inspection
of the two patches of Asparagus on the University farm unexpectedly
showed a more general infection of the plants which were
but one year old. The older plants grow in the narrow flood plain
of a little stream that flows through the farm to the Olentangy;
throughout this patch which is perhaps a dozen years old, the
infection is quite general, though very few of the plants show a large
amount of the Rust, and no perceptible damage to the crop has
hitherto been reported. A year ago seed was sown on higher ground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>about twenty rods from the old patch. The soil is mainly clay with
some loam, and has been cultivated and fairly well manured for
many years. The ground slopes to the west and is well drained,
though the lower portion is perhaps somewhat inclined to be moist.
The plants made an excellent growth. The infection throughout
was general, quite a large percentage of the stalks at this season
being very black from base to tip with the almost contiguous sori or
blotches of Rust. Why these thrifty young plants should be so
thoroughly infected, as compared with the older ones but a short
distance away which have for several years harbored the Rust,
though rather sparingly, is not clear to the observer.</p>

<p class='c012'>A few years ago Prof. Lorenzo N. Johnson, of the University of
Michigan, was at work on a monograph of the Desmids of North
America, intending to make a comprehensive study of the American
species; but his untimely death in the early part of the year 1897,
prevented the fulfillment of this purpose. Some material which
Prof. Johnson had received from Kansas proved very rich in species.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thinking that a list of the determined Kansas species would
make a valuable addition to the Kansas flora, I have obtained the
following list of forty-seven species which was kindly furnished by
Mrs. Johnson, of Evanston, Ill. I have verified the names, and
arranged the genera in the order followed in Engler and Prantl.
Very few localities were given in the card catalogue from which the
list was taken, and only a few others could be added which were
taken from Prof. Johnson’s published articles.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. <span class='sc'>Fig. 1.</span>—A common Moss (M) bearing fruit (<i>s</i> and <i>cap.</i>); one capsule is old, one fresh, one
immature and covered by the calyptra (<i>cal.</i>); the teeth (<i>t</i>) of the peristome (<i>p</i>), and a leaf (<i>l</i>)
magnified, are also shown.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The samples on the accompanying attached sheet are intended to
illustrate the kind of material to be collected, and the method of labelling
and mounting the specimens, for the Herbarium. It will be noticed
that most of the specimens are in “fruit,” which is the popular name
for the “capsule” that terminates the “se-ta,” or slender stem. A
delicate cap called the “ca-lyp-tra,” may usually be seen, completely
or partially covering the capsule before it is fully mature. The terminal
portion of the capsule, called lid or “o-per-cu-lum,” often drops off when
maturity is reached; in this manner the “spores” or microscopical
non-sexual reproductive bodies produced
within, are allowed to escape. The mouth
or opening of the spore case (capsule) is
surrounded by a row of slender teeth, called
collectively the “per-i-stome;” this may
be clearly seen with the aid of a lens after
the ripe operculum is removed. The accompanying
diagrammatic figures illustrate
the parts just mentioned.</p>

<p class='c007'>The life history, or cycle of development,
of our common Mosses may be briefly
sketched as follows: When the spores
germinate a slender branching tube, or
alga-like filament, appears which has been
designated the “pro-to-ne-ma.” This contains
chlorophyll; it grows in moist protected
places, and here and there develops
root-like threads, called “rhi-zoids,” which
anchor it to the soil. “Gem-mae” or buds also appear on the protonema
and these develop into the upright clustered stems that bear the
leaf-like structures. At the apex of the “ae-ro-car-pous” mosses, and
from the sides in “pleu-ro-car-pous” species, there are formed the
organs for sexual reproduction, namely, “an-ther-id-i-a” and “arch-e-go-ni-a;”
these are surrounded by a cluster of leaf-like bracts, called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>the “per-i-che-ti-um” or perichetial scales. This structure, consisting
of the delicate reproductive bodies and their conspicuous and surrounding
protecting organs, has been called the “flower” of the mosses.</p>

<p class='c007'>The microscopic bodies produced in the antheridia (and called
“sper-mat-o-zoids”), and that produced in the archegonia (and called
the “o-o-sphere”), are designated by the term “gam-etes;” it is their
union that constitutes “fertilization.” It can now be understood why
this stage of the development of the moss plant, as outlined in the
preceding paragraph, is designated by the term “gam-e-to-phyte;” it
is the plant (or generation) that produces the gametes. It is in popular
language the “moss” plant.</p>

from which stems develop.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The fusion of the two gametes results in the production of the
sexual spore, called the “o-o-spore;” it develops at once into the second
generation, or second stage in the life-cycle of the moss plant, which
is called the “spo-ro-phyte.” It consists of the seta and capsule; the
lower end (“foot”) of the seta becomes early embedded and fixed in
the tissue of the gametophyte, and from it is derived the nourishment
necessary to complete the development of the sporophyte, or the plant
that produces the numerous non-sexual spores. This “alternation of
generations,”—that is, the alternation of gametophyte and sporophyte,—is
not peculiar to Mosses, but occurs also in the Pter-id-o-phytes and
Sper-mat-o-phytes.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>ADDITIONAL NOTE ON THE SYNDESMON INVOLUCRE.</h2>

<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><span class='sc'>A. Wetzstein.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>In addition to the observations made by Mr. F. H. Burglehaus,
Toledo, Ohio, concerning the involucral leaves of Syndesmon thalictroides
Hoffmg., as stated in No. 5 of the <span class='sc'>Ohio Naturalist</span>, I also
confirm the contradiction in the habitus of plants growing in Auglaize
County with the description in Britton &#38; Brown’s Flora. All
specimens I found here have no sessile involucral leaves, but petioles
mostly about one-fourth of an inch in length. Especially the later
flowering plants, that often grow over one foot high, show petioles
of more than one-half inch in length, while even the earliest—collected
about the middle of April, and no more than three inches
high—exhibit distinctly petioled involucral leaves.</p>

<p class='c007'>It might be very interesting to find out the range of plants with
sessile involucres—for I do not at all think this description of Syndesmon
to be an error in so carefully prepared a Flora as Britton &#38;
Brown’s is, the more as the given figure shows strictly sessile
involucres too.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>MEETINGS OF THE BIOLOGICAL CLUB.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'>FEBRUARY MEETING.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The meeting of the Biological Club, held in the Zoological lecture
room on the evening of February 4th, 1901, was presided over by the
president, Prof. Osborn, about thirty being present.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prof. Lazenby presented “Remarks on Poisonous Plants.” He
mentioned many of the poisons to which the poisonous properties of
various plants are due. Many cases of poisoning are caused by
poisonous fungi gathered with edible mushrooms, and greens
gathered by persons unacquainted with poisonous herbs. Stramonium
has been known to cause cases of poisoning by being gathered
in greens. The distribution of poisonous plants through the various
botanical orders was discussed, and the fact was revealed that a
large percentage of the orders contain such species.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prof. Ball spoke on “Collecting in Colorado.” His remarks on
both faunal and floral conditions are valuable to all, and especially
to those who collect in that western state. He emphasized the fact
that in collecting Hemiptera, general sweeping is not productive of
the best results. Many of the grasses which grow in that country
are at least partially recumbent, and for that reason the sweeping
net misses most of the desirable species. The species of insects
which feed on these grasses are best taken by searching about the
roots, or by lifting up the stems and scrutinizing them closely.
Many new or rare species of Hemiptera have been procured in numbers
in this way.</p>

<p class='c007'>He exhibited many photographs and drawings which revealed
the picturesqueness of the country, something of the flora, and the
difficulties railroad companies experience in getting a track across
the mountains, and left with many present a desire to see the remarkable
scenery for themselves.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>MARCH MEETING.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The Biological Club met in Townshend Hall on the evening of
March 4, 1901, the lantern being kindly furnished and operated by
Professor Hunt.</p>

<p class='c007'>The board of editors through its secretary, Mr. Griggs, recommended
that the offer of Professor Kellerman to take one-half the
numbers of the first volume of the <span class='sc'>Ohio Naturalist</span> for $125.00 be
accepted; and that Professors Schaffner, Osborn and Kellerman be
appointed a committee to consider the disposition of exchanges.</p>

<p class='c007'>The report was unanimously accepted by the club.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Mr. Griggs reported that he and Mr. Tyler had procured a set of
two great horned owl’s eggs from an old hawk’s nest in a beech tree
north of the city, on March 4th.</p>

<p class='c007'>The paper of the evening was given by Professor Osborn on “The
Naples Zoölogical Station.” The paper was illustrated by lantern
and many views of historic places in Europe were given. Naples
and the surrounding country with Vesuvius, Pompeii and other
points of natural or historic interest were shown in a series of fine
views from photographs. The station building with the beautiful
grounds surrounding it appeared in several of the views. The
speaker dwelt at some length on the opportunities given investigators,
the methods of work, equipment in laboratories and library,
and the cordiality of the staff in charge, and expressed the hope that
many of the students in his hearing might at some future time
enjoy the privileges of a sojourn at the station.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Modesta Quiroga was elected to membership.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>In the present number of the <span class='sc'>Naturalist</span> is published some of
the work done last summer at the Lake Laboratory, located at Sandusky,
O. For the announcement for the summer of 1901, or any
other information, address Herbert Osborn, Director, Ohio State
University, Columbus, O.</p>

<p class='c007'>Special Papers No. 3, Ohio State Academy of Science, has been
distributed. This paper deals with “The Preglacial Drainage of
Ohio,” and the authors are W. G. Tight, Granville, J. A. Bownocker,
Columbus, J. H. Todd, Wooster, and Gerard Fowke, Chillicothe.
The paper is a neat pamphlet of seventy-five pages, with a number
of maps and half-tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>Referring to Burglehaus’ note on Syndesmon (<span class='sc'>Ohio Naturalist</span>,
1:72), I may say that I have a number of specimens from Eastern
Kansas, all of which have sessile involucral leaves. Some of the
specimens in the Ohio State Herbarium have sessile leaves, while
others have involucral leaves with petioles one inch or less in length.
That there can be no mistake in the interpretation of what is supposed
to constitute an involucral leaf is shown from the following statement
in Britton and Brown’s Flora, 2:50:—“Involucre of three compound
sessile leaves; leaflets stalked.” Mr. S. E. Horlacher, of Dayton,
Ohio, writes that all the specimens in his herbarium agree with the
Flora in having sessile involucral leaves. There may be several
forms of Syndesmon distinct enough to designate as varieties; there
is at least a large amount of variation.</p>
